# Airline Case Study
This case study aims to analyse the flight operations using characteristics for Airline A and subsequently suggesting the best aircrafts to a start-up airline B by using the previously available data.

### Data Description
Part A - Airline A is currently flying a large international network. Their flight operations are shown in the tab "Operations". Various aircraft characteristics are listed in tab "AC characteristics". They would like to know the following:
1. What is the total cost by aircraft type for the year? </br> Note:	Total cost = Hours flown * Costs/hour									
2. Which aircraft type  has the lowest cost per seat per km flown?

Part B - Airline B is a startup airline and is considering flying on the city pairs as shown in tab "City Pairs". They would like to know: </br>
Which aircraft types are best suited for their operation? </br> Note:	This is an optimization between 3 factors: Range, Passenger demand, costs. Hence the aircraft which is capable of flying between 2 cities (range), has enough seats to meet the demand, and has the lowest cost will win. Please also note that the passenger demand is per day, hence an aircraft can make several trips between 2 cities to meet that demand. One aircraft type will always be most suitable for a given city pair. Hence resultant fleet would be a mix of different aircraft types.
